<h2>Preface</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Both</span> old and young are interested in the
work that the United States is doing on the
narrow strip of land connecting North and
South America,&mdash;digging the Panama Canal,
a highway for the nations. The country is
small, but the work is a great one, and that
little spot on the map is of vastly greater interest
to-day than many a land of larger area.</p>

<p>The history of the country is a romantic
one. The names of Balboa, Pizarro, and
other famous Spanish discoverers are closely
linked to Panama, and readers of history as
well as lovers of adventure are not likely to
forget the part the notorious Morgan and his
men played on the Isthmus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span></p>

<p>There has been much of bloodshed, cruelty,
and oppression in Panama's history, but let
us hope that is all over. The example of
industry and persistent perseverance set by
Americans, as they cut away mountains and
turn great rivers into new channels, ought to
be a source of inspiration to the leisure-loving
native. And such seems to be the fact to-day.
Not only a canal, but a nation, is being built.
New schools, new docks, new water-works,
new streets, new sanitary measures, give evidence
of a better era for Panama.</p>

<p>This all means new possibilities for our little
Panama cousin. As his young American and
English friends read about him, they may well
believe that in the days to come they may all
stand shoulder to shoulder in the onward
march of civilization and progress.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />

<small>HAPPY DAYS</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> young Vasco Barretas, who had both
Spanish and Indian blood in his veins, there
had been born a natural desire for excitement
and adventure.</p>

<p>Just one thing equalled this desire. That
was his dislike for work.</p>

<p>However, we must not blame him for that.
His laziness was the result of training, or
rather the lack of it. Necessities were few and
easily obtained, and he had not learned to care
for the luxuries of life.</p>

<p>On account of Vasco's fondness for bustle
and excitement the time this story begins was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
most glorious for him. As his American
cousin would say, "something was doing."</p>

<p>A successful revolution had just taken place
in Panama.</p>

<p>A revolution was no new thing in the little
strip of country that separates the Atlantic
from the Pacific. Vasco's father had been
through many such affairs. They had been
nearly as regular as the rainy seasons.</p>

<p>Vasco did not understand all about it, yet
even the boys in the streets knew that this
revolution was different from any other.</p>

<p>There had been no bloodshed, but the results
seemed likely to be very important to the
country.</p>

<p>Do you want to know why?</p>

<p>Then listen to a little bit of history.</p>

<p>The State or Province of Panama, on the
narrow bit of land connecting North and South
America, had been a part of the country called
the United States of Colombia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>The great republic to the north, the United
States of America, wanted to dig a canal across
Panama, but had been unable to get permission
from Colombia. And so it looked as if there
might be no canal&mdash;at least not in Panama.</p>

<p>The citizens of Panama were disappointed,
for the digging of a canal through their country
would bring to them many people and much
wealth.</p>

<p>For this reason the leading men concluded
that it was best to separate from Colombia,
organize a government of their own, and come
to an agreement with the United States. At
the time this story opens the new government
had just been set up, and its authority proclaimed.</p>

<p>But, it may be asked, what has all this to do
with Vasco?</p>

<p>To begin with, Vasco's father, in private life
a very ordinary citizen, who sometimes had
been a waiter in a hotel and at other times the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
servant of an American engineer, was deeply
interested in this latest revolution; for was he
not an officer in the new National Guard,&mdash;Lieutenant
Amadeo Barretas?</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 343px;">
<img src="images/i021.jpg" width="343" height="500" alt="Soldier with two boys in the backtround" />
<div class="caption">LIEUTENANT AMADEO BARRETAS</div>
</div>

<p>His position did not require much work,
either of mind or body, but little Lieutenant
Barretas could assume as much dignity as a
seven-foot member of Napoleon's "Old
Guard"&mdash;and more pomposity. When on
parade he would strut about in his gaudy uniform
with all the airs possible, and appear very
serious&mdash;though to you he would have looked
more silly than serious.</p>

<p>There was to be a grand review of the
Panama "army." The soldiers were to parade
through the streets of the city and be inspected
by the commander-in-chief. Several officers
of the United States army were to be guests
of the Panama officials, and occupy a place on
the reviewing stand.</p>

<p>Young Vasco meant to have a good sight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
of the parade. Surely he, the son of a lieutenant
in the army, ought to have a place where
he might see his father march by, and be able
to add his voice to the thousands who
would shout huzzas! But, for some reason,
the officers in charge had neglected to invite
him.</p>

<p>Vasco's home was on a side street in the
poorer section of the city, so the soldiers would
not pass by that place. How, then, could he
get a good view of the parade?</p>

<p>Of course he could stand at the side of the
street; but what chance would a small boy
have in such a place as that?</p>

<p>Now Vasco was a boy of many resources,
and it seemed to him that he might make use
of the good nature of a young American friend.</p>

<p>Harlan Webster was the son of an American
engineer who was in charge of work on the
canal.</p>

<p>Mr. Webster had been for some time upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
the Isthmus, and, unlike most of the Americans
at work on the canal, he had brought his
family, consisting of wife and son, to the city
of Panama. They had now lived here over a
year. During that time Harlan had learned a
good deal about the country. He had also
acquired some knowledge of Spanish, the language
of the natives. In fact, it was said of
him by his Panama friends that he could talk
with the people more freely than many older
foreigners who had been longer in the country.</p>

<p>The American boy knew many Panama lads,
among them Vasco. "Lieutenant" Barretas,
as he insisted on being called, had been in
Mr. Webster's service at various times, and
the two boys had thus become quite intimate
and had taken many pleasure trips together.</p>

<p>Harlan was able to tell Vasco a good deal
about Panama history. The stories about the
buccaneers of old times, about the raid on the
city of Panama, about Balboa and his adventures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
and discoveries, were more familiar to the
American lad than they were to the Panama
boy.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Vasco could give his
friend much information about the every-day
habits and customs of the people, and was able
to take him to many points of interest. When
it came to excursions by water or by land,
Vasco was in his element. He could handle a
boat with skill, he could swim like a fish, and
he knew the windings and curvings of all the
highways and byways of the city.</p>

<p>Straight to the hotel where the Webster
family lived went Vasco this morning. This
hotel was in the better part of the city, not far
from the plaza, or great square.</p>

<p>"Hello, Harlan," said Vasco, after he had
found his friend.</p>

<p>"Hello, Vasco."</p>

<p>"How would you like to see the great army
parade this morning?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>"Fine," was the reply. "Where can we go
to get a good view?"</p>

<p>"That's what I'd like to know. I don't
want to stand in the crowd on the street, for I
could never see anything that way."</p>

<p>"Let's see what my father can do to help
us," said Harlan.</p>

<p>Mr. Webster, who was in an adjoining room,
greeted his son's friend with a pleasant "Good
morning" when the boys appeared before him.
Seeing the eager, inquiring look on their faces,
he asked what he could do for them.</p>

<p>"The Panama soldiers are going to parade
to-day," said Harlan, "and Vasco is anxious
to find a place where he can see them."</p>

<p>Mr. Webster smiled. He had an idea that
Harlan was as anxious to get a view of the parade
as was Vasco.</p>

<p>"Why don't you go into the cathedral and
watch from the tower or from one of the upper
windows?" asked Mr. Webster.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>"None but officials and their families or
others holding tickets can enter the cathedral
till after the parade," replied Vasco, "and all
entrances are guarded."</p>

<p>"If I tell you of a way to get into the
cathedral, do you think you can remain within
till the soldiers go by?" asked Mr. Webster.</p>

<p>"I'm sure we can," replied Vasco.</p>

<p>Mr. Webster, during his stay in Panama,
had been able to pick up information about
the place that even Vasco did not know, and
he said to the boys, "You know where the old
sea-battery is, on the other side of the plaza
from the cathedral?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the two boys together.</p>

<p>"Well, from that battery to the cathedral is
an underground passage, built centuries ago to
afford escape from the building. In times of
revolution there was often danger even within
its sacred walls."</p>

<p>Mr. Webster told the boys how they might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
find the entrance to the tunnel, and at once
they were off to see for themselves. It took
only a few moments to make their way from
the hotel, down the street, across the plaza,
and through a narrow alley to the old battery.
Quickly they passed inside. Here Vasco was
entirely at home, for many times he had wandered
about the place, and with his friends had
played hide-and-seek and other boyish games.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this, it was hard for Vasco
and Harlan to find the entrance to the underground
passage. They opened many doors
and wandered into several blind corridors.
Vasco was almost ready to give up the search,
but his American friend insisted on continuing.
At last, behind a heap of old rubbish, they
found the entrance they had so eagerly sought.</p>

<p>With a brave front the boys went into
the dark passage. After going a few yards,
they found themselves in complete darkness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hope we shall not have to go far in this
dark place," said Vasco.</p>

<p>Harlan pretended to give a careless reply,
but, after he had stubbed his toes and scraped
his shins on various obstacles in the path, he
agreed that the adventure had its drawbacks.</p>

<p>Just then it occurred to Vasco that he had a
supply of matches in his pocket. He scratched
them one by one, thus faintly lighting the path.
Then the boys were able to move forward
more rapidly, and soon they came to what
was evidently the foundation wall of the
cathedral.</p>

<p>Through this wall was a low archway, which
was blocked by what seemed to be a wooden
barricade. There was no sign of a door.</p>

<p>"Well, we are really in trouble now," said
Harlan.</p>

<p>"There's no doubt about that," replied
Vasco as he put his shoulder to the partition.
It did not budge, and the Panama lad was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
again inclined to give up the attempt to get
into the cathedral.</p>

<p>"We may as well give up trying to get in
this way," he said.</p>

<p>"Not yet," was Harlan's reply as they stood
in the dark. "Strike another match, and let's
see what this looks like, anyway."</p>

<p>Vasco scratched another match, and the two
boys hastily looked over the stout planking.
Not a crack nor a loose joint was to be seen.</p>

<p>Just before the match went out, Harlan
glanced backward and spied upon the ground
a stick of timber eight or ten feet long.</p>

<p>"Light another match," he shouted, darting
toward the stick.</p>

<p>Lifting one end of it, he directed Vasco to
take up the other end. It was not very easy
for Vasco to do this and keep his match burning
at the same time, but he managed to do so,
though the light went out just as they reached
the archway again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let's batter down these old planks," said
Harlan.</p>

<p>Together the boys began to pound at the
barricade. Though Vasco was a small lad,
compared with Harlan, his well-trained muscles,
hardened and toughened by out-door life,
came well into play.</p>

<p>Under such hammering as the boys were
able to give, the planks began to loosen, and
soon they made a hole large enough to crawl
through.</p>

<p>Fortunately, this was in a remote part of the
basement, and none heard the noise the boys
had made. No one dreamed of putting a
guard at this point. The entrance had been
so long closed that nearly everybody had forgotten
it.</p>

<p>Passing through, the boys found themselves
in a small room which had been used as a
storeroom.</p>

<p>"See the relics here," said Harlan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mostly old rubbish, I guess," was Vasco's
reply.</p>

<p>Whether relics or rubbish, the lads had
no time to stop and examine the stuff. They
made their way to a steep stairway, down which
a ray of light came from a crack in the trap-door
overhead.</p>

<p>Without a moment's delay Vasco and his
friend mounted the stairs. With a strong push
they put their shoulders to the heavy timbers
of which the door was made. But the door
had been too long settled in its place to yield
at once to their pushing. By persistent effort,
however, the door was moved. Slowly the
boys raised it, looking carefully about as their
eyes became accustomed to the light which
flooded the room into which it opened.</p>

<p>It proved to be an anteroom on the main
floor of the cathedral into which the boys had
come. Vasco immediately recognized their
surroundings. No one else was about, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the boys were able to make their way without
challenge to the portico facing the plaza.
Once mingled with the throng, there was no
danger of any one interfering with their movements.
It was taken for granted by the soldiers
that Vasco and his friend had a right
to be in the cathedral.</p>

<p>In truth, several of the guards were members
of Lieutenant Barretas's company, and
they knew Vasco, who had often visited their
camp. They supposed, however, that the son
of one of their officers had a right within the
space reserved for guests. Vasco, in turn,
knew who these particular soldiers were, and
was not long making friends with them.</p>

<p>While waiting for the marching soldiers,
Vasco told Harlan something of the history
of the cathedral, which is built of yellow stone,
with high Moorish towers.</p>

<p>As the boys looked up to the great dome,
Harlan asked:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>"What makes the dome sparkle so in the
sunshine?"</p>

<p>"That's because of the hundreds of pearl
shells that are stuck into the cement covering,"
replied Vasco.</p>

<p>"Do you know," continued Vasco, "that
this great building was put up nearly one hundred
and fifty years ago?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Harlan, "and I have heard
that its builder was the first coloured bishop
of this city."</p>

<p>"That is true," said Vasco, "and he was
the son of a poor man who burned charcoal
and then sold it from his back through the
streets of Panama. The son was very kind to
the poor people, and was noted for his charity."</p>

<p>"Yes," added one of Vasco's soldier acquaintances
who stood near and overheard the
talk, "and this cathedral is really a monument
to the useful life of the bishop."</p>

<p>Further conversation was interrupted by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
music of a brass band in the distance. The
boys looked down the street by which the
soldiers were to come to the plaza. In the
distance they soon saw the uniforms of the officers
followed by the long white lines of the
soldiers.</p>

<p>Vasco's enthusiasm knew no bounds as the
battalion wheeled into the plaza and passed by
the cathedral with salutes for the onlookers.
When he finally spied his father, Lieutenant
Barretas, marching at the head of his company,
Vasco was delirious with joy. To his mind,
not even the general in command looked finer
than did the little lieutenant&mdash;his father!</p>

<p>What cared Vasco if the lines of soldiers
were not precisely straight? Even less did he
mind Harlan's criticism and lack of admiration
for the parade. Were not these soldiers enlisted
in the service of his country, and were
they not ready to lay down their lives in its
defence?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>Vasco's only wish was that he were old
enough to join them and wear the uniform
which to him seemed so glorious.</p>

<p>But, like all spectacles, grand as it seemed
to Vasco, this one at last came to an end.
The last flag had dipped before the reviewing
stand, the last soldier had disappeared from
the plaza, the last beat of drum was lost in the
distance.</p>

<p>Meantime, the sun had risen high, and with
its hot rays was driving to cover all the people
of Panama. As was their usual custom,
shopkeepers and market-men closed their
doors at eleven o'clock and betook themselves
to their homes to enjoy their noonday <i>siesta</i>.</p>

<p>Even the throngs of boys forsook their
sports and disappeared from the streets, and
Vasco and Harlan took their departure from
the cathedral,&mdash;the latter to his cool room
in the hotel, the former to his more humble
home.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />

<small>ABOUT THE CITY</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Perhaps</span> you would like to know more
about Vasco Barretas&mdash;who he is, his home,
his surroundings, his occupations, his ambitions.
Of the two latter there is little to be
said. Like many of the boys of Panama,
he had no occupation&mdash;not even going to
school&mdash;and no particular ambition. If any
thought of the future ever did come into his
mind, it was quickly forgotten for some pleasure
of the moment.</p>

<p>It is fair to Vasco to say that it was not his
fault that he did not attend school. Under
the Colombian government there had been no
public schools. There had been a few private
schools under the care of the priests, but their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
equipment was very poor, and accommodations
were limited.</p>

<p>Under the new government there was destined
to be an improvement in this respect,
and the year after the Panama Republic declared
its independence, there were more than
three thousand children in the schools, though
previous to that there had been less than five
hundred.</p>

<p>Vasco's home was a humble one, though it
does not follow that it was unhappy. The
contrary was the fact.</p>

<p>There were two children younger than
Vasco,&mdash;Inez, his eight-year-old sister, and
the little baby brother Carlos. The parents
loved their children as fathers and mothers do
everywhere, and were willing to sacrifice much
for their welfare.</p>

<p>Both Lieutenant Barretas and his wife
boasted of their Spanish ancestry, though they
were of mixed descent, and there was evidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
of Jamaica negro blood in their features. Perhaps
this accounted for Vasco's aversion to
hard labour, though the strict truth of history
does not reveal that the early Spanish discoverers
were specially fond of manual toil.</p>

<p>Though Vasco's home could boast no luxuries,
he had never seen the time when there
was lack of food, and for clothing all he required
was a pair of trousers and a shirt, both
made of cheap linen cloth. Boy readers will
realize the glorious possibilities in such a scanty
attire.</p>

<p>Much of his time Vasco spent about the
streets of the city, indulging in sports and
games with boys of his own age. Often he
went to the water-front and watched the loading
and unloading of vessels. He specially
liked to watch the fishermen as they came in
with their little vessels, and brought their finny
harvest ashore.</p>

<p>Fish are very abundant in Panama waters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
The name of the city means "abounding in
fish." Years ago many whales were caught
off the coast, and whaling vessels were a common
sight in the harbour.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 341px;">
<img src="images/i041.jpg" width="341" height="500" alt="People on street" />
<div class="caption">A STREET IN PANAMA</div>
</div>

<p>At present, in addition to the edible fish,
sharks are numerous in the Pacific near Panama.
On one occasion Vasco had gone on
a short fishing trip in one of the larger boats
with the father of a boy friend. A shark was
seen following the boat, and in consequence
other fish were scared away.</p>

<p>To rid themselves of the unwelcome intruder
the fishermen attached a piece of pork
to a large fish-hook held by a small chain.
To this was fastened a stout rope. No sooner
was the baited hook cast overboard than the
shark made a rush for it and swallowed it
whole. When he found he was caught, there
was a terrible lashing of the water, the shark
leaping bodily into the air and vainly snapping
his teeth again and again upon the chain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>After the fish had become pretty well exhausted,
the men drew him on board the boat,
but not without a fierce struggle. Soon he
was killed, though not without much unnecessary
torture.</p>

<p>Often Vasco wandered into the market district
of the city. Many of the vendors of
vegetables, fruits, and provisions occupied the
narrow sidewalks, displaying their wares in full
view of the passers-by.</p>

<p>At other times Vasco would spend hours
under the shady palms in the great plaza watching
the passing to and fro of all classes of
people,&mdash;some on foot, some in carriages,
some mounted on donkeys, and occasionally a
military officer on horseback. When one of
the latter came in sight, Vasco, with scores
of other boys, would run a long distance to
keep watch of the fine figure in such an
abundance of gold braid.</p>

<p>The water-sellers, with their little carts drawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
by wobegone-looking donkeys, were always
an object of interest to Vasco. He felt that it
would be almost as much fun to ride about on
a water-cart all day as to be a soldier.</p>

<p>Among the buildings within Vasco's vision
as he sat in the plaza was the Cabildo, or town
hall, which is the Independence Hall of Panama,
for here was signed the Declaration of
Independence from Spain. Naturally the place
is an object of much reverence to the natives.
Near by is the Bishop's Palace, an imposing
structure where much important Panama history
has been made. At the present time the
street floor is occupied by the great Panama
Lottery Company. Let us hope that some
day the people of that country will be delivered
from this national shame, and the lottery
banished.</p>

<p>Sunday evenings there was always a band
concert in the plaza, and Vasco never failed to
be present. Generally he took with him his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
sister Inez, and sometimes his mother, with
little Carlos, would accompany them. This
was always a joyful occasion, for Vasco liked
nothing better than to hear the music and
to watch the continual passing of the people.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />

<small>A TRIP TO OLD PANAMA</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Though</span> Vasco had explored nearly every
nook and corner of the city in which he had
lived, he had never visited what was called
Old Panama.</p>

<p>You must understand that the Panama of
to-day is not on the site of the original city.
The present city was built after the former one
had been destroyed by the buccaneers. Of
them you may learn something further on.</p>

<p>The so-called "modern" Panama was
founded in 1673. As protection from pirates
and buccaneers a high stone wall was built
around the city, which cost over eleven million
dollars. That seems to us an enormous sum,
and to the people of those days it was fabulous.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
It gives some idea of the vast wealth that must
have been stored in the city to admit of such
an outlay for its protection. Few traces of
this wall now remain. As civilization has
advanced, and life and property have become
safer, it has gradually been torn down.</p>

<p>One day, not long after the great military
review, Vasco was down at the water-front
watching the fishermen unloading their boats.
As it happened, he fell in with Enrique Mendoza,
in whose father's boat he had witnessed
the capture of the shark.</p>

<p>Enrique, as well as Vasco, was always looking
for some new adventure. At this time
he hailed his friend with a glad shout, and
asked:</p>

<p>"What do you say, Vasco, to a trip over to
Old Panama to-morrow? Father will let us
take a small boat he is not using, and we
can go part of the way in that."</p>

<p>Vasco was much pleased at the invitation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
but was in doubt as to whether it were perfectly
safe for them to go without some one for
protector and guide, as he had heard many
disquieting stories about the old city.</p>

<p>"Have you ever been over there?" he asked
Enrique.</p>

<p>"Many times."</p>

<p>"Do you know the way about?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do. I have often been there
with father. Besides, there's an old friend of
his who lives in a hut near the ruins, and
he will be glad to show us about."</p>

<p>When Vasco heard the last statement, he
hesitated no longer. "I'll go, then," he said.
"I have never been there, and I should like
to see what the place looks like. What do
you say to asking my American friend Harlan
to go with us?"</p>

<p>"That will be fine. The boat will carry
three all right, and we will have all the jollier
time."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>Enrique had never seen Harlan Webster,
but he had heard Vasco talk about him, and
was greatly pleased at the thought of having
him along on this trip. He had seen and
heard enough of the Americans about the city
to know that they were very active and enthusiastic.
So he felt certain that this American
boy would add to the fun of the excursion.</p>

<p>"All right, then," said Vasco. "We'll
start early to-morrow morning. What time do
you say?"</p>

<p>"Six o'clock won't be too early. It will
take at least three hours to get over there.
That will give us a little time to look around
before the middle of the day, when it will
be too hot to move about. Then in the afternoon
we can search among the old ruins awhile,
starting for home in season to get here before
dark."</p>

<p>This plan suited Vasco, and he took leave
of Enrique, saying that he would see Harlan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
sometime during the day. He had little doubt
that the young American would go with them.</p>

<p>As the day was now well advanced, though,
Vasco first made his way home, when for several
hours he remained within doors. He told
his mother of his plans for the next day, to
which she made no objection. She rarely interfered
with his movements, except that sometimes
she asked him to do some chores about
the house, and occasionally required him to
look after Inez and his baby brother while she
was away on an errand.</p>

<p>In the latter part of the afternoon Vasco
went to see if Harlan could go with him the
next day. It didn't take long to give the invitation,
and it took Harlan even less time to
accept it, so far as he was concerned.</p>

<p>"Wait a moment, though," he said to Vasco.
"I must ask my mother if she is willing for
me to go with you."</p>

<p>To Vasco this seemed unnecessary. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
never thought of having to ask his mother
about such things. But he had known Harlan
long enough to learn that American ways,
especially so far as boys were concerned, were
different from Panama customs.</p>

<p>The American boy immediately went to his
mother and told her what he wanted. At first
she was inclined to object to his making this
trip with only two other boys for companions,
but his arguments and persuasions finally overcame
her scruples, if not her fears, and he
secured her consent.</p>

<p>Back to Vasco he hurried and told him the
welcome news.</p>

<p>"Remember, now," said Vasco as he took
his leave, "and be at the beach near the Panama
Railroad pier at six o'clock sharp."</p>

<p>"I surely will. Good night," was Harlan's
reply.</p>

<p>Both boys retired in good season that evening,
to get well rested for their early start.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>At dawn next day Vasco sprang out of bed.
He was not concerned about the weather, for
this was the dry season of the year, when
for months no water falls, and there was no
danger of rain preventing the day's outing.</p>

<p>Quickly he ate the breakfast his mother provided,
and many minutes before the appointed
time was on his way to the meeting-place.
Though the first on the scene, he did not have
to wait long for the other two boys. Enrique
was the second to arrive, and shortly afterward
Harlan made his appearance.</p>

<p>Harlan was glad to meet Enrique, and felt
sure that if his mother could have seen the
sturdy brown fisher-lad getting the boat ready
she would have had no concern for their safety.
All three boys were familiar with boats, though
of course Harlan's acquaintance was with less
rudely built craft than the one in which they
were to cross the bay.</p>

<p>Each boy had brought along fruit for lunch.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
In addition, Vasco had some hard-boiled eggs,
wrapped in corn-husks, as sold in the market.
Eggs are not bought by the dozen in Panama,
but by the pair. The boys expected either
to catch fish or to get some from Juan, Enrique's
friend who lived in the hut near the
old city.</p>

<p>Soon they got under way in the little boat,
with its sail spread wide to catch the light
morning breeze. Enrique was at the rudder
and Vasco acted as lookout at the bow, while
Harlan made himself as comfortable as possible
midway. All of them hugely enjoyed the sail
across the bay.</p>

<p>Old Panama is only about four miles northeast
of the present city in a straight line, but
as the boys went, partly by water and partly on
foot, they had to cover a much longer distance.
That did not trouble them, however, especially
while in the boat.</p>

<p>After sailing about an hour, a landing was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
made at Point Paitillo, which forms the protection
for the upper side of the Bay of Panama.
The boat was safely drawn up to shore
and made fast to a huge boulder by a long line.</p>

<p>As the tide was high when they landed, they
knew there was no danger of the boat's going
adrift later in the day. In fact, as the tide
receded it left the craft high and dry upon the
shore. At Panama the tide has a rise and fall
of about twenty feet.</p>

<p>The boat secured in its position, the boys
took up their way afoot. They passed along
the rocky shore, through some swampy lowland
and over broad green fields, crossing many
little brooks and rivulets.</p>

<p>To Harlan especially this walk was delightful.
He greatly admired the park-like trees and
shrubs, the luxuriant tropical vegetation, the
beautiful scenery, fleeting glimpses of city and
sea, and over all the clear blue southern sky.</p>

<p>After awhile the boys came to Algarrobo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
River, which empties into the sea close beside
the ruins. The stream was spanned by an old
stone bridge, built over 350 years ago. Across
this they made their way and came in sight of
the old city&mdash;or what was visible in the
bewildering mass of tropical vegetation.</p>

<p>They did not immediately go into its depths,
however, but, led by Enrique, sought out the
hut of Juan, who lived a hermit life on the
border of this city, where years ago there had
been a great tide of humanity, and where ambition,
avarice, gaiety, luxury, once had full
sway, but now was only a memory. Where
once thousands of people had thronged, now
the only living things were serpents, alligators,
iguanas, pumas, and such.</p>

<p>The boys were fortunate in finding Juan at
home, and as it was now well toward the middle
of the day, they were glad to get into
the shelter of his little thatch-roofed hut,
and rest their weary limbs after the long walk.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />

<small>STORY OF THE BUCCANEERS</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Enrique's</span> friend Juan was a fine specimen
of the Panama Indian. He was straight, clean-limbed,
big-boned, well-shaped. His long,
coarse, straight black hair hung loosely upon
his shoulders. He was not very tall, but out-door
life had made him nimble and active and
strong, and Harlan especially admired his athletic
appearance.</p>

<p>Indians of unmixed blood are a rarity in
Panama now, and Juan was exceedingly proud
of the fact that no Spanish or negro blood
flowed in his veins. This, too, probably accounted
for his living alone. He was a member
of the Tule or San Blas tribe of Indians,
which not many years ago lived on the Atlantic
coast of Panama, peaceably pursuing an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
honest, industrious life, occupied in fishing,
hunting, farming, and sometimes trading.</p>

<p>Juan knew well what his ancestors had suffered
from the Spaniards centuries ago, and how
much it had cost to resist successfully their attacks.
In consequence, he had no love for the
white man. His hatred, however, did not
include everybody, and he was on terms of
close friendship with Enrique's father, who
often marketed the fish Juan caught.</p>

<p>The Indian met Enrique and his companions
with a smile, his even white teeth gleaming
between his thin lips. He gave them a warm
welcome, and invited them into the shelter of
his hut, and the boys were very glad to accept
his hearty hospitality.</p>

<p>"We have come to visit the old city," said
Vasco, "and Enrique said you would be glad
to show us about and tell something of its
history."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, but not now. Sun too hot. Go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
in and lie down. By and by we go to see the
ruins."</p>

<p>Within the hut swung a hammock, which
was generously given up to Harlan, while Vasco
and Enrique made themselves comfortable on
a rude grass couch covered with skins.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Juan set about, in his deliberate
way, to prepare a meal for his visitors.</p>

<p>"Doesn't it seem strange," said Harlan to his
companions, "that this place where there were
once so many people should now be deserted?"</p>

<p>The American boy, though as full of fun as
any lad, had a poetic nature, and in quiet moments
was either building air-castles or dreaming
over past events. The historic associations
of this place brought to his mind much that he
had read of the early visits of the Spaniards
and of the bold buccaneers who followed in
their trail.</p>

<p>Harlan's question had not much meaning
either to Enrique or to Vasco, for in fact they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
knew much less about the history of the
country and of their ancestors than did their
American friend. But Vasco had enough curiosity
to be interested in Harlan's question and
the thought that might be behind it.</p>

<p>"Were there, then, very many people living
here?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, thousands and thousands.
After his discovery of the Pacific Ocean Balboa
founded the city, and thousands of Spanish
countrymen flocked to the place in search of
gold."</p>

<p>Harlan came very near saying something
about their treatment of the native Indians, but
he happened to think that Vasco and Enrique
were both descendants of these same conquerors,
and he was wise enough to hold his tongue.</p>

<p>"Many of the Spaniards," he continued,
"succeeded way beyond their wildest dreams,
and right here where you see these old ruins
they were able to pile up a big lot of gold."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>"If they became so rich," asked Vasco, "how
did it happen that the city was deserted and
fell to ruin?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that is a long story, and I am not sure
that I could tell it very well, either," replied
Harlan.</p>

<p>"There's plenty of time before Juan will
have dinner ready," broke in Enrique, "and I
am sure we would both like to hear how Old
Panama was destroyed. You may be certain
that not many boys in this country know the
story, and it will give us something to brag
about."</p>

<p>"Well, then," began Harlan, "you must
know that for many years your ancestors and
mine quarrelled, particularly over the control of
the sea and its commerce. It was a long fight
between the English and the Spanish, and it
was a bitter one, too. Millions of dollars were
spent, and blood&mdash;well, that flowed in rivers.</p>

<p>"In the search after wealth in the new world,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
the old rivalry between Spanish and English
continued, and I guess that when it came to a
fight neither side stopped to ask which was
right or wrong. The men who sailed the
ships on both sides were nothing but a set of
pirates, and the governments at home didn't
much care what the sailors did to their enemies.</p>

<p>"Thus it came about that a fierce and strong
band of buccaneers, under Henry Morgan,
was allowed to attack the Spanish vessels even
at times when the nations were supposed to
be at peace, though of course with no direct
authority. It was this Morgan and his blood-thirsty
cutthroats who destroyed the old city
of Panama."</p>

<p>"How did you learn all this?" interrupted
Vasco. "I have lived here all my life and
never heard about this Morgan, though I have
heard my father say that some of his ancestors
were among those who lost life and property
when the city was destroyed."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh," said Harlan, "some things I learned
in history at school, but a great deal I got from
books of adventure that father has given me.
If you only could read English I would
lend you some of them, and you would find
out much more than I can possibly tell you.</p>

<p>"But let me tell you about Morgan and his
men. The old pirate chief himself was a
Welshman, and if I remember correctly his
father was a respectable farmer.</p>

<p>"The son didn't love the quiet life of a
Welsh farmer, and so he left home when quite
young. He joined the crew of a merchant
vessel, and sailed for Barbados.</p>

<p>"Here he had very bad luck, which no
doubt was partly the cause of his awful cruelty
to his enemies in later years. He fell into the
hands of the Spaniards and was sold into
slavery."</p>

<p>"I'm mighty glad there are no slaves now,"
broke in Enrique. "I've heard my father tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
some things about the way they lived, and it
must have been terrible."</p>

<p>"It surely was," replied Harlan, "and yet
the conditions of slavery with which your
father is familiar were as nothing compared
with the sufferings of slaves in Morgan's time.
Probably his case was no better than others,
but, as matters turned out, he succeeded after
a time in getting his freedom. I can't tell you
just how this was brought about, though I am
sure his great strength and daring must have
had much to do with it.</p>

<p>"Morgan next went to Jamaica, where he
joined a band of pirates&mdash;mostly English and
French&mdash;who attacked the Spanish treasure-ships
in these waters. You can easily imagine
that Morgan's part in this business wasn't
small. He never thought of such a thing
as mercy. The crews of captured ships who
weren't killed in the battles had to walk the
plank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>"Fortune favoured Morgan, and, unlike
most of his companions, he saved his booty,
and in a little while was able to buy a ship.
In this vessel he had as villainous a body of
men as ever walked the deck.</p>

<p>"With his ship he joined other pirate captains,
and it was not long before he was in
command of a fleet of fifteen vessels, with over
five hundred men,&mdash;men who were not afraid
of anything, and who did dreadful things wherever
they went.</p>

<p>"With the constant additions to their force,
the buccaneers began to spread out. They
were not satisfied with capturing ships and
killing their crews, but began to go upon
the land, and a good many native and Spanish
settlements in the West Indies and on the
shore of South or Central America suffered.
Wherever the pirates suspected Spanish treasure
might be stored, they were sure to make
their appearance, sooner or later. Town after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
town was captured and destroyed, and everything
of value carried away."</p>

<p>"But what has all this to do with Panama?"
asked Vasco, who, though interested in Morgan's
history, was anxious to learn about the
destruction of the city.</p>

<p>"I'm coming to that very soon," replied
Harlan. "After a time Morgan and his men
began to wonder if they could not capture
Panama, which was then the chief city of all
this region, and was famous everywhere for its
vast wealth. And, as so often happens, the stories
about its wonders far exceeded the reality.</p>

<p>"The inhabitants did not dream that the
buccaneers would ever dare to attack Panama,
fortified as it was, and defended by Spanish
soldiers. But they didn't know much about
the spirit which was in Morgan and his men,
and they didn't realize to what the greed for
gold would lead.</p>

<p>"To make a long story short, Morgan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
decided to attack Panama. By this time he
had twelve hundred followers. Landing about
forty miles from the city, with only a small
supply of provisions, they took up their long
march through forests and over the mountains
and across the streams. They could not move
very fast, and the men were nearly starved. I
remember reading in some book, that at nightfall
often the happiest man in the company
was the one who had saved from his breakfast
a small piece of rawhide on which to make his
supper."</p>

<p>Vasco, who could make good use of anything
eatable at any time, and who even now was
wondering if Juan had dinner nearly ready,
could not restrain an exclamation at this statement.
"How could they live on that sort of
stuff?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know, myself," replied Harlan,
"but we are told that the skins were first
sliced, then dipped in water, and afterward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
beaten between stones. The morsel would
then be broiled, cut into bits, and deliberately
chewed, with plenty of cold water to wash
it down.</p>

<p>"In addition to the danger of starvation, the
pirates were in constant fear of ambuscades.
The Spaniards, who knew of their approach,
sent out parties of soldiers to meet them and
hinder their march, though the defenders of
Panama knew very well that they would lose
a pitched battle. Consequently they confined
themselves to attacks from the cover of the
dense forests, and in this way many a buccaneer
was killed."</p>

<p>"Weren't the Englishmen able to find anything
to eat while on the way?" asked Enrique.</p>

<p>"Very little indeed," replied Harlan, "until
the ninth day, when they came to the
outskirts of this city. What they saw there
was very pleasing to these hungry men. On
the broad, level land the other side of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
bridge we just crossed were great herds of
cattle."</p>

<p>"I'll wager they made a rush for them,"
said Vasco.</p>

<p>"They did, you may be sure," continued
Harlan, "and so hungry were the men that
they would hardly stop even to cook the meat.</p>

<p>"Their hunger satisfied, Morgan and his
men moved on, and very soon caught a glimpse
of the roofs and towers of the city. Then what
a shout went up! The pirates, tired as they
were, tossed their caps in the air and rushed
forward with cheers. Drums were also beaten,
and the invaders acted like crazy men at the
thought of securing the rich treasure that lay
in the city before them.</p>

<p>"Many of them wished to charge on the
city and capture it at once, but their leader
gave wiser counsel, and the pirates went into
camp for the night, intending to move forward
early in the morning."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>"I should think the pirates would have been
afraid to attack the city," said Vasco, "for there
must have been many Spanish soldiers on
guard there."</p>

<p>Probably Vasco had a higher opinion of
Spanish bravery than did Harlan, but the
young American gave no hint of his real
thought. He simply said: "The pirates
were the most desperate men on earth, and in
their position it was win or die, for they could
expect no quarter, and could not retreat over
the path by which they had come.</p>

<p>"It is true," continued Harlan, "that the
Spaniards greatly outnumbered the buccaneers,
and they tried all sorts of schemes to defend
the city. Among other things, they collected
a great herd of bulls and drove them
into the pirates' ranks with the hope that such
disorder would be created as to make easy the
enemy's destruction.</p>

<p>"But all that could be done in defence was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
useless against the villains who were greedy for
gold. No mercy was shown, and death was
the lot of all on either side who fell into the
hands of their foes.</p>

<p>"After fierce fighting, which continued several
days, Morgan and his men got into the
city. Immediately the search for treasure was
begun. Every house and building was ransacked,
and if any inhabitant dared to resist, his
life was immediately taken. Even helpless
women and children were not spared."</p>

<p>"I don't see why they killed those who
were unable to resist them," said Vasco.</p>

<p>"One reason why the pirates were so merciless
was because of their disappointment.
Though they did find vast stores of silver and
gold, in many houses they were unable to find
anything of value. This was because some of
the people who lived in the city had hidden
their treasure&mdash;in many cases burying it deep
in the ground."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is so," interrupted Enrique, "and I
have heard my father tell of seeing people come
here to dig for buried gold. I never heard,
though, that any one found much."</p>

<p>"Let Harlan go on with his story," said
Vasco, sharply. "I want to hear how Morgan
succeeded. Besides, I'm beginning to get
hungry."</p>

<p>"There isn't much more to tell," said the
young American. "When the pirates had
finished their hunt they set fire to the city. At
the same time they went on killing the people.
Special vengeance was visited on the priests,
for the robbers had been unable to find the
great store of plate which the Church was
supposed to possess.</p>

<p>"Morgan stayed here four weeks, taking
everything of value, both on land and in
the harbour. It is said that when he finally
left the place it took one hundred and seventy-five
mules to carry the plunder."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>"What became of Morgan finally?" asked
Vasco.</p>

<p>"Soon after his capture of Panama, I
believe," replied Harlan, "he was appointed
by King Charles the Second of England as
deputy governor of Jamaica. Afterward King
James the Second removed him and threw him
into prison for his crimes."</p>

<p>"And good enough for him!" was Vasco's
comment.</p>

<p>Just at this time Juan appeared in the doorway
of the hut. "Come, boys, let's have
something to eat," he said.</p>

<p>That was an invitation none of them cared
to refuse, and they responded as only three
hungry boys could.</p>

<p>Outside on a rude bench was spread the
fresh fish that Juan knew so well how to cook
over his camp-fire, together with Vasco's boiled
eggs, potatoes, plaintains, and all sorts of vegetables
and fruit. The sail and the long walk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
had added zest to appetites always splendid,
and the good things on the bench disappeared
as if by magic.</p>

<p>"I must say," said Harlan, "that that's
about the best tasting fish I ever ate. And I
have eaten a good many kinds, too."</p>

<p>Juan, silent like most of his race, said nothing
in reply to the compliment, but a significant
look and a grunt of satisfaction showed that
he appreciated the American boy's remark.</p>

<p>The boys finished their meal with generous
mugs of hot cocoa. Juan was an expert in its
preparation, but to his own particular draught
he added a seasoning of chili pepper. This he
drank boiling hot,&mdash;a process which would
have terribly scalded the mouths and throats
of his visitors, but the Indian swallowed the
hot mixture without any trouble and with
much satisfaction.</p>

<p>Vasco and his friends looked on in amazement,
and were all the more surprised when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Juan told them that in years gone by it was
the fashion of his forefathers to sit upon
the ground with open mouths while their
squaws poured the boiling mixture down their
throats.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 342px;">
<img src="images/i077.jpg" width="342" height="500" alt="Pepole looking at old tower" />
<div class="caption">THE TOWER OF THE OLD CATHEDRAL</div>
</div>

<p>Their generous dinner disposed of, Vasco
suggested that they immediately begin the exploration
of the old city. This was agreed to
by the others, and under Juan's guidance they
at once made their way into the dense jungle
which had grown up about the ruins.</p>

<p>Neither of the Panama boys was very romantic
in disposition, but Vasco could not help
thinking of the pirates of whom Harlan had
told,&mdash;how they had trod this very ground,
and how back and forth Spaniards and buccaneers
had swept in bloody battle. All the
military ardour which had been born in his
breast was aroused, and he even caught himself
wishing that he had been there to help
defend the city. Little did he realize how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
much less enchanting was the experience than
the story.</p>

<p>It is not possible to describe all that the
boys saw. As they wandered back and forth
they imagined that here was a market-place,
and there was the residence of some rich old
Spanish trader. Over yonder was all that remained
of a bishop's palace, and near by may
have been the governor's abode.</p>

<p>The old cathedral was easily identified by
the tower which still stands. Within its walls
the boys went and gazed with awe upon the
ancient altar on which Pizarro, the adventurous
explorer and conqueror, had left an offering to
the Holy Virgin before starting on his voyage
to Peru.</p>

<p>Time passed swiftly, however, and it was
Enrique who discovered that the sun was fast
setting.</p>

<p>"We must soon be starting," he said to
Vasco, "if we are to get home before dark."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>Harlan, who overheard what Enrique said,
was anxious to start immediately, for he knew
his mother would be worried if he were late.</p>

<p>So bidding Juan good-bye and thanking him
profusely for his kindness to them, the boys
took up their homeward march across the old
bridge and along the coast. Not so much
time was spent on the way as in the morning,
for now they were intent only on getting home.</p>

<p>The boat was found safely fast where they
had left it, and, quickly spreading the sail,
they were soon speeding across the blue waters
of the bay. The sail was a delightful one,
the cool breeze fanning their cheeks while the
slanting rays of the sun cast a glory over the
scene which subdued their boyish spirits and
filled them with awe as they gazed about them.</p>

<p>Before long, however, they arrived at the
water-front of the city. Here was a busy,
bustling scene. A great steamer from San
Francisco had arrived during the day, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
gang of negro labourers was busily transferring
the freight from its capacious hold to
the cars which stood alongside on the dock.
On the other side of the Isthmus the process
would have to be repeated in a reverse manner.
The freight would be unloaded from the
cars and shipped to New York, New Orleans,
Liverpool, and other ports of the United
States and Europe.</p>

<p>At the same time numerous small boats
were drawn up near the beach, discharging
fish, poultry, fruit, and various cargoes. Here
the boys saw a sight which was new even to
Vasco, though he had seen about everything
that went on in Panama. A small schooner
from up the coast had brought in a cargo of live
pigs for the Panama market. The vessel was
not made fast to a wharf and the pigs taken
out over a gangplank, but it was moored as
near the beach as safety would allow. Then
the pigs were dumped overboard and compelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
to swim for land, where they were
caught. Later they would be slaughtered and
their carcasses exposed for sale in the market-place.</p>

<p>The sight of the squealing, swimming pigs
was very amusing to Vasco and Harlan, and
they watched with glee the unloading of the
whole boat-load before they went ashore.</p>

<p>"What queer-looking pigs those are!" said
Harlan.</p>

<p>"Why?" Vasco asked.</p>

<p>"See how lean they are, and what long
snouts they have!"</p>

<p>"Well, isn't that the way all pigs look?"</p>

<p>"Not up in my country," replied Harlan.
"Those that I have seen were so fat that they
could hardly move. These pigs are not at all
like them; though I have heard that in the
Southern States many of the wild hogs are thin
and long-legged."</p>

<p>Soon the boys bade each other good night,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
and Vasco went to his home ready for the
supper his mother had prepared for him.
Not long afterward he went to bed, thoroughly
tired, but very much pleased with his day's
outing. If he dreamed at all that night there
must have appeared a strange mixture of
Spaniards and pirates and Indians and ruins
and&mdash;pigs!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />

<small>AN EARTHQUAKE</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Vasco</span>," called his mother to him early
one morning a few days later, "I want you to
get up and go to market for me."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, I don't want to get up now,"
said Vasco.</p>

<p>"No matter," replied his mother, "you'll
want something to eat by and by, so hurry
up."</p>

<p>Vasco knew it was no use to protest further,
and, as the process of dressing was a very short
one with him, he soon was ready to do his
mother's errand.</p>

<p>"What do you want me to get this morning?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"I want you to get some potatoes and peas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
and rice and half a yard of beef," his mother
replied, as she handed him a basket.</p>

<p>It sounds strange to hear about a yard of
beef, doesn't it? Vasco did not think so,
though, for in Panama beef, instead of being
sold by the pound, is often cut into long strips
and sold by the yard.</p>

<p>By the time Vasco was all ready to start his
sister Inez was up.</p>

<p>"May I go with you?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Of course, if you want to. Come on."</p>

<p>So together they trotted out of the house
and off to market.</p>

<p>Inez looked about her with wide-open eyes,
for her visits to the market, especially in the
early morning, had been very rare.</p>

<p>"See what a lot of donkeys standing over
there," said the little girl, pointing across the
street.</p>

<p>"Yes; they belong to the fruit-sellers you
see here. The animals stand there all day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
long, and at night, when their masters and
mistresses have sold all their stock, they ride
home on the backs of the donkeys. Some of
them go many miles into the country, too."</p>

<p>But other sights soon attracted Inez's attention,
and the donkeys were forgotten.</p>

<p>Many of the buyers were women cooks
dressed in red and yellow and green and bright
colours of all sorts. They made the place look
very brilliant.</p>

<p>Soon, however, Vasco had done his errands
and with Inez hurried home for breakfast.</p>

<p>Sometimes, in the evening, Vasco would go
out with his mother and Inez and little Carlos.</p>

<p>On Sunday evenings, as you have already
learned, they went to the plaza and listened
with rapt attention to the band concert.</p>

<p>Quite often, on these occasions, Vasco's
father, the lieutenant, would have a leave of
absence from his military duties, and would go
with his family. Then Vasco was supremely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
happy, for he was extremely proud of the
gorgeous uniform which his father wore, and
felt as if some of the military glory were
reflected upon him.</p>

<p>Since Panama had become an independent
nation, much patriotic music had been played
at these concerts, and the large crowds were
always enthusiastic.</p>

<p>On one Sunday evening, soon after the
boy's visit to Old Panama, all the members of
the family except little Carlos were listening
to Vasco's tales of the sights he had seen in
the old city. He also was repeating the story
of the buccaneers that Harlan had told him.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Barretas was especially interested
in what Vasco said about the treasure buried
amid the ancient ruins.</p>

<p>"Our ancestors," he said to his son, "were
not the only ones who left their wealth buried
in the ground about here. The pirates who
so cruelly robbed the early settlers of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
country often hid their ill-gotten gains in
caves in the sand on the shore or upon some
barren island. Then they sailed away, and
sometimes never returned to secure their treasure.
If the stories were to be believed, all we
need to do to obtain untold wealth is to take
picks and spades and turn up the earth along
the coast of our country or on the islands near
its shores.</p>

<p>"Years ago a good many people actually
spent much time searching for hidden gold.
I remember hearing my grandfather tell of a
neighbour who formed one of a party that went
to Cocos Island for such a purpose.</p>

<p>"It seems that many years before a dying
pirate had confided to an old countryman, a
carpenter by trade, that a vast store of gold
was buried on Cocos Island."</p>

<p>"I have heard of that place," interrupted
Vasco. "Some of the sailors whom Enrique
and I know have mentioned it. The island is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
several hundred miles from Panama, and there
are no people living on it."</p>

<p>"That is true," said the lieutenant. "Well,
this carpenter was nearly mad with joy at
the information the dying pirate gave him.
He thought surely that his fortune was made.
No more hard work for him! All he needed
to do was to dig up the treasure, and for
the rest of his life enjoy ease and freedom
from care."</p>

<p>"I don't much blame him, father, do you?"
asked Vasco.</p>

<p>"I can't say that I do," was the reply.
"I'll admit I wouldn't mind digging up a pot
or two of gold myself, though I don't believe
that we take so much stock in the stories of
hidden wealth as our fathers and grandfathers
did.</p>

<p>"With this carpenter, however, it was a
pretty serious question how he was going to
get to Cocos Island and secure the treasure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
He knew the island was a desert place and far
from shore. It would be necessary to have
a ship, a good store of provisions, and tools
with which to do the digging, to say nothing
of a company of men to help him. All
this required much money, and our poor carpenter
had none. But he was possessed of
a large amount of courage and perseverance,
and he managed after a time to enlist the help
of men of means, who furnished the capital for
the expedition.</p>

<p>"Many hardships were endured by the little
band of men who made up the carpenter's
company, but they finally arrived at the
island.</p>

<p>"The pirate had not made very clear the
exact location of the hidden gold, and as
the island was covered with a dense growth
of trees and vines, the search was a heartless
task from the beginning. The men, however,
got to work, and with picks and spades<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
and gunpowder managed to uncover a large
part of the island."</p>

<p>"And did they find the gold?" asked
Vasco, his face now aglow with excitement.</p>

<p>"Not any," replied his father. "Several
months they dug and blasted, but all in vain.
No sign of chest, box, silver, or gold was
found. Day after day the search continued.
Finally the provisions became exhausted, the
men grew disheartened, and a weary, disappointed
company of men returned to Panama."</p>

<p>Just as Vasco's father finished his story a
strange rumbling noise was heard. You would
have wondered what it was, and perhaps have
been a little frightened. The Barretas family,
however, knew in a moment what had
happened.</p>

<p>"An earthquake!" cried Vasco.</p>

<p>Even as he spoke two or three tiles fell
from the roof into the street. A startling
clatter breaking the stillness of the evening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
proved that the tiles had been shaken loose
from neighbouring houses, also.</p>

<p>"We'd better get out quick," cried the
lieutenant, and he made a dash for the door.</p>

<p>Vasco and his mother were more thoughtful
about the younger children, and, while the
mother rushed into the bedroom after Carlos,
Vasco took Inez by the arm and followed
closely on his father's heels.</p>

<p>In a moment the whole family was in the
street.</p>

<p>"Get away from the house!" shouted
Vasco's father. "The tiles are likely to fall
upon you if you don't."</p>

<p>To the middle of the street they all dashed,
where they were quickly surrounded by a
noisy, chattering mob of men, women, and
children.</p>

<p>Again the earth seemed to shake and to
shiver, and the shrieks and moans of frightened
women and children were accompanied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
by the sound of more falling tiles and cracking
timbers.</p>

<p>The experience was truly fearful, even to
the older and wiser ones. The terror of the
young children was something to excite pity in
the most hardened breast. It was only by the
utmost efforts and constant reassurance that no
harm would come to her that Vasco was able
to quiet his sister Inez. Even after her cries
had become stilled she trembled like a leaf.</p>

<p>Fortunately the shock was a light one and
the shaking and trembling of the earth were
soon over. Lieutenant Barretas and his
family returned within their house none the
worse for the adventure, and went to bed, but
many of their neighbours lingered in the street
for hours&mdash;some even until daylight, when
the terror of the night was dissipated by the
cheerful rays of the rising sun.</p>

<p>The earthquake had been a mild one compared
with some instances of previous years.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
In September, 1882, the city had been visited
in the night by a terrible shock. The
darkness always adds intensely to the terror
of the people. On this occasion men and
women of all classes&mdash;high and low&mdash;had
rushed to the street. Great hotels were emptied
in a few moments, many guests not stopping
even to put on clothing.</p>

<p>The great plaza was one vast mass of
shouting, crying people, while the earth heaved
and the air quivered as it had never done in
the memory of the inhabitants. Many houses
were ruined, much property destroyed, and
it is said that some even died from fright.</p>

<p>At daybreak new courage revived the
hearts of the people, but for several nights
the plaza was occupied by tents and all sorts
of rude shelters for thousands who dared not
sleep in their houses.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />

<small>A JOURNEY</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">A few</span> days after the earthquake, early in
the forenoon, there came a rap at the door of
Vasco's home. Inez, always alert, ran to the
door, and, throwing it open, saw Harlan
Andrews standing there.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Inez," said the young
American.</p>

<p>Inez had become quite well acquainted with
Harlan because of his many visits to Vasco,
and was always glad to see him. So she gave
a cheerful smile and hearty response to his
greeting, and invited him to enter.</p>

<p>"Is Vasco at home?" asked Harlan, as he
came into the living-room.</p>

<p>"Yes, he is out in the courtyard. If
you will sit down I will call him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>Harlan thought he was quite fortunate to
find Vasco. Generally at this time of day
he was out upon the streets with other boys
of his age.</p>

<p>In a moment Vasco came into the house,
and, boylike, Harlan stated his errand without
any preliminary conversation.</p>

<p>"Father is going to make a trip to Colon in
connection with his canal work, and will spend
some time on the way, particularly at the Culebra
cut. Perhaps, too, he will go up the
Chagres River to the place where it is proposed
to build the big dam. He is going
to take me with him, and says I may invite
you to go along."</p>

<p>"Oh, that will be fine!" exclaimed Vasco,
and he fairly jumped up and down with glee.
In fact, he was so overwhelmed by the thought
of the proposed journey that he nearly forgot
to thank Harlan for the invitation. When he
did come to his senses, his gratitude was profuse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
and his tongue could not begin to express his
thoughts.</p>

<p>Then again, after a few moments, he remembered
that this trip was for more than
a day, perhaps for more than a week, and
it might be necessary to consult his parents
before accepting the invitation. At once he
turned to his mother, who had overheard all
the conversation.</p>

<p>"Are you willing I should go with
Harlan?" Vasco inquired.</p>

<p>For a moment his mother did not reply,
and the boy was very anxious for fear that
when she did give her answer it might not
be favourable.</p>

<p>Finally the señora said, "If your father has
no objection, I think I am willing to let you
go."</p>

<p>"Then I'll go now to ask him. Come on,
Harlan," said Vasco.</p>

<p>The lieutenant was stationed in the city at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
this time, so the boys had not far to go.
Vasco did not anticipate any great difficulty in
gaining his father's consent to the journey.
As the result proved, his hopes were well
founded, for Lieutenant Barretas was quite
willing his son should go anywhere, provided
he was in Mr. Andrews's care.</p>

<p>"It's all right, then," said Harlan when the
matter was decided. "Meet me at the railway
station next Monday morning at eight o'clock."
This was Friday.</p>

<p>For Vasco, the two days between Friday
and Monday passed&mdash;oh, so slowly! It
seemed as if they would never go by!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, his mother gave him a bit of
information which later turned out to be of
value. "You say you may go up the Chagres
River?" she asked her son.</p>

<p>"Yes, so Harlan told me," was Vasco's
reply.</p>

<p>"I have never told you that I have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
brother living in that part of the country&mdash;your
Uncle Francisco Herreras. The last I
knew of him he had a plantation not far from
Palo Grande. I hope, if you go near there,
you may be able to call upon him. I am sure
he will be very hospitable to you all."</p>

<p>At last Monday morning came. Very
early Vasco awoke, ate the breakfast his mother
made ready for him, and long before the hour
appointed was ready to start for the railway station.
He was so impatient to be on his
way that he left home a full hour earlier
than was necessary. Consequently, he had to
wait a long time at the depot.</p>

<p>But time flies, even for the most impatient
lads, and in due time Harlan and his father
made their appearance.</p>

<p>"What do you think, Vasco?" said Harlan.
"We are going to have a special train!"</p>

<p>"Where is it?" asked Vasco, who saw no
sign of anything of that sort in the depot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, it's not in here. It's outside in the
train-yard. We are going out there to get
aboard."</p>

<p>Vasco thought this a little strange, but felt
that he could ask no questions. In a moment
Mr. Andrews called to the boys to follow him,
and led the way outside the station.</p>

<p>Directly they came in sight of an engine, to
which was attached a box car and a flat car
such as are ordinarily used for freight. On
the flat car were fixed several seats, and an
awning had been erected as protection from
the fierce rays of the sun. In the box car
were well-equipped bunks, where the members
of the party might sleep at night when better
accommodations were wanting.</p>

<p>"This is our special private car," said
Harlan. "What do you think of it?"</p>

<p>"I think it will suit me all right," said
Vasco.</p>

<p>Mr. Andrews explained to the boys that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
was on a tour of inspection in connection with
the canal work, and this train had been placed
at his disposal. He was glad, in connection
with his work, to give a pleasure trip to the
boys. He hoped it might also prove an
instructive and beneficial one to them.</p>

<p>While Mr. Andrews had been talking to
the boys they all had climbed upon the flat
car and taken seats. Then, with a wave of
the hand to the engineer, the signal was given,
the throttle opened, and the train began its
journey.</p>

<p>Slowly it moved until away from the city,
but when it had passed out upon the beautiful
broad savannahs, or grassy plains, which lie
near Panama it moved with greater speed.
To Vasco it seemed very fast indeed, though
it was far otherwise to Harlan, who had ridden
on the rapid express trains in his own country.</p>

<p>As the train drew farther from Panama they
came to a more hilly region. In turn they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
passed through Corozal, Rio Grande, Miraflores,
Pedro Miguel, and Paraiso. Most of
these places were small settlements. Near the
little railway stations would be seen a few
wretched houses. What few inhabitants were
in sight appeared to be of native Indian descent
and wandered about in scanty clothing,
with no apparent occupation.</p>

<p>At Paraiso the train was run on to a
side-track.</p>

<p>"We shall have to wait here awhile for the
regular passenger-train for Panama City to
pass us," said Mr. Andrews.</p>

<p>"How long shall we have to wait?" asked
Harlan.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sure I don't know. The trains
on this road come when they please and go
when they get ready. You may as well take
it easy till we can go on again."</p>

<p>"How long does it take to run across
the Isthmus?" asked Vasco.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>"Generally about three hours for the forty-mile
trip, but as I just told Harlan, you can't
be sure of anything on this road. They ought
to give better service, for they carry nearly
one hundred thousand people a year."</p>

<p>Fortunately our friends did not have to
wait very long, and when they again had a
clear track they proceeded on their way.</p>

<p>"It must have been a big job to build
this road," said Vasco, as they rode on.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 344px;">
<img src="images/i103.jpg" width="344" height="500" alt="man explaining excavation to man and boy sitting on bench" />
<div class="caption">"'THAT SCOOP WILL DIG OUT OF THE MOUNTAIN A TON OF EARTH AT A TIME'"</div>
</div>
<p>"Yes," replied Mr. Andrews, "it was a
great triumph of American genius. During its
construction multitudes of men were killed by
the deadly fever, but finally Chinese labourers
were imported and successfully completed the
work, though even many of these Oriental
coolies died."</p>

<p>The train whirled on through rocky hills
and valleys luxuriant with tropical foliage. As
it approached Culebra Mountain Vasco's eyes
opened wide at the sights he saw. From<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
the main track various spurs were laid, on
which stood giant steam-shovels.</p>



<p>Pointing to one of them, Mr. Andrews
said: "That scoop will dig out of the mountain
a ton of earth at a time. Then it is
swung around and its load emptied into a
gravel-car. In this manner train-load after
train-load is taken from the sides of the mountain
each day and hauled away and dumped
either into a valley or into the sea at Colon."</p>

<p>Vasco also saw large gangs of men at work
on the side of the mountain. Most of them
were negroes from Jamaica. As the boys
watched them at their labour Harlan said to
his friend: "Well, those fellows can't be accused
of trying to work themselves out of a
job. I reckon they would move livelier than
that if they were at work on some of our
American railroads."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />

<small>CULEBRA</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the Culebra station Mr. Andrews's train
stopped. "Now, boys," he said, "it is nearly
noon. We will see what we can get for
dinner, and then I shall have to leave you to
yourselves for the rest of the day. I have
considerable business to which I must attend.
All I ask is that you keep out of danger
and show up at supper-time. We shall sleep
in the car to-night and to-morrow go on our
way to Colon."</p>

<p>"That will give us the whole afternoon to
look about this place, and I think we can
manage to see a lot in that time," said Harlan.</p>

<p>"I'm glad we're going to have some dinner
first," said Vasco, "for I'm hungry."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come on, then," said Mr. Andrews, and
he led the way to a large wooden shanty a few
rods from the station. The building was dignified
with the title of a "hotel," and served as
a boarding-place for the American overseers of
the gangs of men at work in the Culebra cut.
Here the three sat down to a generous meal.
There was not much style about it, but Mr.
Andrews cared little for that, and certainly the
boys were not fussy.</p>

<p>Dinner over, the boys were left to their own
devices.</p>

<p>"I tell you what let's do," said Vasco.
"We'll climb to the top of Culebra Hill this
afternoon. We can get a splendid view of the
country, and we can certainly get back in time
for supper."</p>

<p>"That suits me," said Harlan.</p>

<p>At once they started. From the level of
the railway tracks, the climb at first was up the
steep and slippery banks that had been made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
by the steam-shovels. Many times the boys
lost their foothold and slid backward, only to
renew the struggle and clamber upward once
more.</p>

<p>As they got higher up their progress was
hindered by the dense undergrowth of shrubs
and vines, so that they were obliged to make
many a turn and twist in their path. In some
places they could not get through the bushes,
and had to tramp a long way around to gain a
few yards toward the summit.</p>

<p>Finally their perseverance was rewarded, and
they stood upon the top of the great hill.
Such a scene was spread before them as is
seldom witnessed. In the immediate foreground
far below them they could see the
hundreds of men at work. They looked
hardly larger than ants and not half so active.
Here also they saw the labourers' camp,&mdash;a
collection of rude shanties closely huddled
together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>Looking farther out, the scene was more
attractive. Down through the valleys the rich-looking
tropical foliage made a picture no artist
could reproduce, and even boyish spirits were
subdued as Vasco and Harlan gazed about them.
In the distance ridge upon ridge of hills arose,
adding grandeur to the magnificent view.</p>

<p>Awe-inspiring as was the handiwork of nature
spread before them, to these boys the
great work which man was here undertaking
seemed even more wonderful. The scores of
steam-shovels in sight were scooping up tons
upon tons of earth every hour. Vasco could
hardly believe it when Harlan told him that it
would take years to complete the work of
cutting through the mountain. The great
valleys in the locality would be entirely filled
with the earth, and thousands of car-loads
were to be hauled to Colon and dumped into
the Atlantic.</p>

<p>Little did those early Spanish explorers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
English buccaneers who travelled over this
country imagine that great ships&mdash;many
times larger than any they ever dreamed of&mdash;would
be sailing through this mountain.</p>

<p>Vasco could hardly fancy such a thing now,
but Harlan, with sublime confidence in American
skill and force, had perfect faith in the early
completion of the Panama canal. Certainly
here before him was splendid evidence of
American purpose.</p>

<p>When the boys had become thoroughly rested
after their hard climb, and had concluded that
there were no more worlds to conquer in this
direction, they began to think of returning
to the camp. The declining sun also reminded
them that it was time to be on the move.
Possibly, also, a vigorous appetite added to
Vasco's zeal for the return journey. At any
rate, he said to Harlan: "What do you say
to a race to the railway station?"</p>

<p>This suggestion suited the American boy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
and in a trice they were off,&mdash;running, jumping,
sliding, tumbling, dodging, twisting, and
turning in the race for the foot of the hill.
There was just enough danger in it to add
interest to the contest.</p>

<p>In the end Vasco won, though Harlan
pressed him closely all the way. Several times,
indeed, he seemed to gain the lead, his shrewdness
and good judgment proving nearly a
match for the sturdy limbs and deep breath of
his opponent.</p>

<p>The race over, the boys wandered about
watching the shifting gravel-trains, the giant
steam-shovels in operation, the hundreds of
men at work, and toward the close of the day
returned to the car.</p>

<p>Here they found Mr. Andrews, and with
him went to supper. At an early hour thereafter
they turned into their bunks in the
"sleeping-car," where, with nets protecting
them from hungry mosquitos and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
insects, they soundly slumbered through the
night.</p>

<p>Early in the morning the three travellers
were again on their way, for Mr. Andrews was
anxious to get to Colon. They did not even
go to the "hotel" for breakfast, but ate some
canned food which had been brought along
in the "sleeper." Taking his meals on a railway
train was a novelty for Vasco,&mdash;more so
than a dinner in the finest Pullman dining-car
would have been to Harlan. None the less,
Harlan enjoyed the novelty of the situation
as much as his Panama friend.</p>

<p>Breakfast eaten, the boys devoted themselves
to watching the scenery along the route.
The forests through which they passed
abounded in all sorts of bird and animal
life.</p>

<p>As the train whirled along, the boys caught
glimpses of wild turkeys, bright-coloured macaws
and parrots, as well as of innumerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
smaller birds. Monkeys were seen darting
about amidst the foliage. Once also a drove
of peccaries was seen scuttling away through
the undergrowth. These little animals resemble
the Virginia wild hog in shape, and are
black in colour. The natives of Panama kill
them for food.</p>

<p>The trees were innumerable in variety. Besides
the ordinary oak, cedar, beech, and ash,
were seen teak, rosewood, mahogany, and
ebony in abundance. When they become
more accessible, these will bring fortunes to
their possessors.</p>

<p>Vasco called particular attention to the macaw-trees.
He said they bore a very palatable
fruit about the size of a pear, with a stringy
covering and a stone in the centre. In old
times the Indians were very fond of it, and
recklessly cut down thousands of trees for the
sake of the fruit alone. They used the black
and very hard wood for arrow-heads.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>As the train rolled into Obispo, the travellers
got their first glimpse of the Chagres
River, which forms such an important link
in the construction of the canal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />

<small>BALBOA</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Along</span> the river's bank the train sped. As
it approached Matachin Mr. Andrews pointed
to a high hill not far away.</p>

<p>"Do you know what hill that is?" he asked
Vasco.</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, you ought to, for it is the spot of
greatest historic interest in your country.
Cerro Gigante, or Big Hill, is its name, and
from its summit was gained the first sight of
the Pacific Ocean. Do you know who the
discoverer of that ocean was?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, it was Balboa, who also helped to
build the city of Panama. I have heard my
father speak of him."</p>

<p>"Balboa's life was full of adventures," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Mr. Andrews, "and included many dramatic
incidents, but none equalled in intensity the
moment when he first sighted the broad blue
Pacific, which he called the 'Sea of the South.'
At the head of a little band of tired Spaniards
he toiled up that hill. The vision that met
his eyes amply repaid him for all the hardships
and privations he had suffered&mdash;and they had
not been few."</p>

<p>Vasco's interest was now thoroughly aroused,
and he asked Mr. Andrews to tell him more
about Balboa and his adventures.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I do not know very much about
Balboa, but I am very glad to tell you what
I can.</p>

<p>"If I remember correctly, he was born
about 1475 in Spain. So you see he was just
coming to young manhood when the wonderful
discovery of a new world by Columbus
thrilled every Spanish heart.</p>

<p>"Balboa was of noble parentage, though his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
family had become poor. A few years after
the discovery of America he sailed with Bastides
and coasted up and down this country.</p>

<p>"At first he was very successful in his ventures,
but on account of the sinking of his ship
he settled in Santo Domingo, and undertook to
make his living by farming. In this he failed.
Soon his savings were spent, and he found
himself in debt. This was a serious matter
for Balboa, as under Spanish law debtors were
shown very slight consideration."</p>

<p>"Why didn't he run away?" asked Vasco.</p>

<p>"That is just what he wanted to do,"
replied Mr. Andrews, "but it was almost
impossible to get away from the island unobserved.
Finally, however, he made a desperate
effort. He placed himself in a cask and
caused it to be carried from his farm on board
a ship that was ready to sail for South America.</p>

<p>"When well out to sea, he appeared to the
captain, who at first was exceedingly angry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
The captain relented, however, after he had
heard Balboa's story, and allowed the fugitive
to remain with him.</p>

<p>"Later, a wealthy friend supplied funds for
an expedition of which Balboa was the head.
At first he was unsuccessful and results were
not promising, but on a visit to the Isthmus
much wealth was secured, and Balboa's great
success&mdash;the discovery of the Pacific&mdash;was
attained.</p>

<p>"The building of the city of Panama soon
followed. It was from that place that Pizarro,
one of Balboa's companions, a few years later,
sailed for Peru, whence such fabulous wealth
was carried back to Spain. You saw in the
ruins of the old cathedral the altar where
Pizarro offered sacrifice to the Holy Virgin."</p>

<p>Here Mr. Andrews concluded his story,
and Harlan added:</p>

<p>"You did not tell Vasco that Balboa made
friends with an Indian chief on the Isthmus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
and married his daughter. More than that,
unlike a lot of Spanish explorers, he really
loved his Indian wife and remained true to
her&mdash;so true, in fact, that he afterward lost
his life on her account."</p>

<p>"And was Balboa finally killed, then?"
asked Vasco.</p>

<p>"Yes; he was executed by order of a jealous
governor of the Isthmus," replied Mr.
Andrews.</p>

<p>"That seems strange, after all he had done
for his country," said Vasco.</p>

<p>"I know it does," was Mr. Andrews's answer;
"but that was the way Spain often dealt
with her adventurous explorers. Many of
them deserved their fate much more than
Balboa, though."</p>

<p>While Mr. Andrews had been telling the
story of Balboa, the train continued to roll on.
Gorgona, San Pablo, and Tavernilla were
passed in succession. Bohio was a special<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
point of interest, for here, as Mr. Andrews
told the boys, the canal is to enter the artificial
lake to be formed by a great dam. When
complete, there will be a broad, deep body of
water seven miles in length, affording room for
anchorage as well as for navigation.</p>

<p>Gatun was the next place of importance,
and not long after the train passed through
Monkey Hill, a suburb of Colon, and finally
into the city of Colon itself.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />

<small>COLON</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Arriving</span> in Colon, as they did about midday,
the boys had little desire to go sightseeing
immediately. The weather was too hot and
uncomfortable. They ate dinner at a hotel
with Mr. Andrews, but it was decided to sleep
on board their car every night. It was as
comfortable as any place they were likely to
find.</p>

<p>As the car was side-tracked upon the railway
dock, they had the full benefit of the sea
breezes, and during the remainder of that day
Vasco stayed upon the car with Harlan, watching
the waves roll in from the broad Atlantic.</p>

<p>Colon is situated on the extreme point of
land between Limon and Manzanillo Bays.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
There is really little harbour, and in case of
severe storm little protection for shipping.</p>

<p>"Sometimes there are terrible storms here,"
said Harlan, "when the waves come in with
tremendous force."</p>

<p>"I can see along the shore," said Vasco,
"where much damage has been done."</p>

<p>"That is not the worst, either," continued
Harlan. "During these storms many lives
have been lost. It was only a little while ago
that one of the most severe of these 'northers'
attacked this coast. Father was telling me
about it, as he happened to be in Colon at the
time.</p>

<p>"Three steamships put to sea for safety and
remained away three days. The gunboat <i>Dixie</i>
also ran out as quickly as it could to escape the
danger. Not a vessel of any kind remained in
the harbour except two schooners in the slips
close by this station. They were tied by a
number of cables at a sufficient distance from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
the piers to prevent damage from the pitching
and rolling. They couldn't get away, and rode
out the gale.</p>

<p>"Great waves rolled directly into the harbour,
breaking over the water-front, and even the
streets were filled with water. From a number
of houses the people had to get out."</p>

<p>"It doesn't look now as if the sea ever
could do such harm, does it?" said Vasco.</p>

<p>"Indeed it does not. It is very calm and
gentle this afternoon. Father told me that
one of the plans in connection with digging the
canal is the building of a big breakwater here."</p>

<p>"If that is done the harbour will be much
safer, won't it?" asked Vasco.</p>

<p>"Yes, and the entrance to the canal will be
less likely to suffer damage in a storm," said
Harlan.</p>

<p>"It looks as if a number of old wrecks were
strewn along the shore now," said Vasco,
indicating at the time numerous hulks that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
appeared just above the surface of the water
along the shore.</p>

<p>"Those are relics of the French effort to dig
a canal here. Scores of scows were built by
the De Lesseps company, and when work was
given up they were left to decay and sink."</p>

<p>"Why didn't some one take care of them?"
asked Vasco. "They must have cost a lot
of money."</p>

<p>"That's one of the questions no one can
answer, any more than one can tell why so
many costly engines and steam-shovels and
dredges were left to rust and grow useless by
exposure."</p>

<p>"I remember we saw some of them near the
railway. A good many were more than half-buried
in the sand, too," said Vasco.</p>

<p>Thus the boys whiled away the afternoon,
and at night, with Mr. Andrews, turned into
their berths in the "sleeper."</p>

<p>In the morning, after an early breakfast, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
boys started to explore the town. They found
that most of the buildings were mere wooden
shanties.</p>

<p>"This city makes me think of some of the
beach resorts in my country," said Harlan.
"The houses are just such flimsy affairs."</p>

<p>There were no cellars, and the houses were
set up on stakes. The streets hardly deserved
the name, and were littered with all kinds
of dirt and filth.</p>

<p>Even Vasco, who could not be accused of
being particular, said that he much preferred
to live in his own city of Panama.</p>

<p>After dinner, during the hottest part of the
day, the boys indulged in a <i>siesta</i>, and later
took a walk to Coconut Point, where the
French had built a number of fine houses, and
cleared and drained the land to make healthful
surroundings for the officers of the canal
company.</p>

<p>One specially elegant house was built for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
sole use of De Lesseps&mdash;and he occupied
it less than one hour. The whole situation
and surroundings were ideal and a splendid
reminder of the extravagance of the French
canal company.</p>

<p>At night, when the boys returned to their
car, Mr. Andrews told them that he had completed
his business in Colon, and that they
would start on the return trip in the morning.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />

<small>UP THE CHAGRES RIVER</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">After</span> another night on the "sleeper" in
Colon, Mr. Andrews and the boys started
on their return journey. The trip was made
as far as Obispo without special incident.
Here a halt was made and the train shifted
to a side-track. Mr. Andrews was obliged to
inspect the site of a proposed dam near
Alhajuela. This was about ten miles northwest
of Obispo, and the journey would have
to be made by a boat and on foot.</p>

<p>It was too far to go that day, so Vasco suggested
that they go to Palo Grande and hunt
up his uncle, Francisco Herreras. "I am
sure," said the boy, "that he will give us all a
hearty welcome and be glad to provide shelter
and food for us."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let's go there," said Harlan to his father.
"It will be lots more fun than staying here
to-night. It will give us more chance to see
the country, too."</p>

<p>Vasco's suggestion was favourably received
by Mr. Andrews, who proceeded at once to
carry the plan into effect.</p>

<p>On going to the nearest river landing-place
to see if he could find a boat and men to
row them up-stream, he met with unexpected
good fortune. Two natives, who had come
down to Obispo with a boat-load of bananas,
were just ready to return, and were glad to
earn an extra sum by taking along three passengers.</p>

<p>The boat in which passage was secured was
a large flat-bottomed affair, suitable for navigation
of the shallow stream. On the way up
many similar boats were seen, also rude canoes
propelled by single persons.</p>

<p>Vasco and Harlan, full of curiosity as boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
always are, were soon on familiar terms with
the boatmen, who told them that in former
times many of the canoes were hollowed out
of the trunks of cottonwood-trees.</p>

<p>The boys learned, too, that the Panama
native Indian is a natural sportsman. Parrots,
monkeys, pigeons, and small deer are his
favourite game. His life is a very simple one.
Nature provides him with bread in the shape
of bananas and plantains. He makes his
own pottery from the clay beneath his feet,
and in place of knives and spoons uses
gourds cut into proper shape.</p>

<p>He sleeps in a hammock or on a couch of
bamboo with hides thrown over it. The hammocks
are woven by the women.</p>

<p>All the time the boat was making good
progress, and about four o'clock in the afternoon
arrived at Palo Grande. On inquiry,
it was learned that Señor Herreras lived
about two miles west of the river, and after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
securing definite directions as to the route
our friends started to walk to the plantation.</p>

<p>To Vasco, as well as to Harlan, the sights
along the way were of special interest, for he
knew nothing of country life. The growing
corn, tobacco, indigo, coffee, vanilla beans,
and other products of the country were a
source of wonder to him. Even Mr. Andrews
could well believe, with a former visitor
to Panama, that "here it would puzzle a
healthy man to die of hunger."</p>

<p>In less than an hour Señor Herreras's plantation
was reached. It was now Vasco's turn
to serve as guide and leader of the party.
Finding his uncle at home, he introduced him
to his friends, and told him of their desire for
food and lodging.</p>

<p>"It is with great pleasure I welcome you all
to my humble home," said the señor. "Will
you kindly follow me within that you may
rest after your long walk, and I will see that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
food is served to you at once. It is about our
supper-hour, any way.</p>

<p>"And how is my sister, your mother?" Señor
Herreras continued, addressing Vasco. "It
has been many a long year since I have seen
her."</p>

<p>"She is very well indeed, uncle, and it is
because she told me of you that I am here
with these friends. She said you would be
sure to give us a royal welcome."</p>

<p>"And glad I am you took her advice. I
only wish she were with you. Sometime I
hope I may get down to the great city to see
her."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, all had stepped within the house.
The visitors were given an opportunity to
remove the travel-stains, and by the time
this had been done they were ready for the
food which was set before them.</p>

<p>Vasco was specially glad to find that here
were two cousins of about his own age, Jago<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
and Alfeo, and before long the four boys were
very well acquainted with each other.</p>

<p>The meal ended, Vasco's uncle inquired of
Mr. Andrews as to his plans for the next day.</p>

<p>"I intend to go on up the river to Alhajuela,
where I have some business in connection
with the canal work."</p>

<p>"Did you expect to take the boys with
you?"</p>

<p>"That was my plan."</p>

<p>"Well, why not let them stay here until you
return. I will agree to take good care of them,
and my boys will show them all about this
place. I am sure they would all have a fine
time&mdash;perhaps better than if they went with
you, for boys love boy company."</p>

<p>"You may be right," said Mr. Andrews,
"and I think I will accept your generous
invitation on behalf of the boys. This is
Wednesday, and I shall probably get back
here Friday."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very well, then, we will consider that
settled," said the host.</p>

<p>Early the next morning Mr. Andrews
resumed his journey, Vasco's uncle providing
a horse and accompanying him as far as the
river.</p>

<p>Thus the four lads were left to their own
devices.</p>

<p>"Let's take the boys down to the sugar-mill
first," said Alfeo to his brother.</p>

<p>"That's a good idea," was Jago's reply,
and Vasco and Harlan readily fell in with the
suggestion.</p>

<p>Vasco's uncle raised much sugar-cane on
his plantation, and in this mill he also did
grinding for neighbours who were less fortunate
and were unable to possess mills of
their own.</p>

<p>Harlan found that the "mill" was not at
all like what he imagined, and he regarded it
as rather a small affair, but Vasco was immensely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
impressed with the wonderful work
it performed.</p>

<p>It consisted of three upright cylinders of
very hard wood, two of them about five feet
long and one in the centre two feet higher.
They were set close to each other, and a crude
cog-wheel made the three revolve together.</p>

<p>An arm from the top of the central cylinder
extended outward about fifteen feet. To this
oxen were attached. Round and round in a
circle the animals walked, and as they did so
the machinery revolved. The stalks of cane
were fed between the cylinders, and the heavy
pressure squeezed out the juice, which fell into
a large tub below.</p>

<p>Near by the boys saw the juice boiled. A
great iron kettle was set in rough stone masonry,
and dried cane was used for fuel. The
boiling process was watched by an old woman,
who was constantly dipping up the syrup with
a long-handled gourd dipper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 340px;">
<img src="images/i135.jpg" width="340" height="500" alt="Village iwth huts and palm trees and people" />
<div class="caption">A NATIVE VILLAGE</div>
</div>

<p>Vasco and Harlan were each given a drink
of the partially boiled cane-juice, which they
found very pleasant to the taste.</p>

<p>"After the boiling is completed," the old
woman told them, "the sugar is run into
wooden moulds and then wrapped in plantain
leaves, when it is ready for the market."</p>

<p>Harlan and Vasco were next taken to visit
an aged woman who in years gone by had
been a cook in Señor Herreras's father's
household. This woman was said to be
nearly a century old, and could tell the boys
much of the ancient customs and habits of
Panama.</p>

<p>The house in which she lived was like
many of the native huts. It was very simply
built. Four trees about six inches in diameter
had been cut down, the branches lopped off,
and a Y-shaped fork left at the tops. These
four trees were set deep into the earth as
corner posts. Side pieces were lashed on top<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
with withes. The roof was made of small
saplings thatched with native grasses, bunches
of which overlapped each other like shingles.</p>

<p>In this particular hut there were two rooms,
and an attic overhead, though many houses
have no upper room. The sides of the hut
were made of plaited split bamboo, and the
chinks were filled with mud.</p>

<p>The old woman always welcomed the visits
of Jago and Alfeo, and she was also glad to
see the two young strangers. They found it
easy to enter into conversation with her.
She told how the Indians in her youthful
days used to adorn their bodies with figures
of birds, beasts, and trees. The women did
the painting and took great delight in it.
The men also wore a crescent-shaped metal
plate over the lip, attached to the nose, and
the women wore a ring in the same manner.</p>

<p>"What were the rings made of?" asked
Vasco.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sometimes of gold, but more often of
silver or of some cheaper metal," replied the
woman. "Chains of animals' teeth and shell
were also common.</p>

<p>"You would have laughed to see how the men
used to smoke tobacco," continued the old
woman. "Instead of a cigar, or even a pipe,
long strips of tobacco leaf were wound into a
roll two or three feet long and as large as your
wrist.</p>

<p>"A boy would light one end of the roll and
burn it to a coal, wetting the leaf next the fire
to keep it from wasting too fast. The lighted
end he put in his mouth and blew smoke
through the roll into the face of each man
in the company, no matter how many of them.
Then they, sitting down as usual, with their
hands made a kind of funnel around their
mouths and noses. Into this they received
the smoke as it was blown upon them, snuffing
it greedily and strongly as long as they could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
hold their breath. It seemed to give them
great pleasure."</p>

<p>"I don't think I should have liked the
boy's task," said Vasco.</p>

<p>"Did the boys go hunting when you were
young?" asked Alfeo.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. They did not have guns for
weapons, but used bows and arrows. They
could shoot very straight with them, too.
Just wait a moment and I will prove that to
you."</p>

<p>The old woman hobbled to a chest in the
corner of the room and took therefrom an old
bamboo cane.</p>

<p>"Do you see the cleft in the end of that
cane?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do," answered Alfeo.</p>

<p>"Well, that was split by an arrow shot at
twenty paces by my oldest brother when he
was only eight years old."</p>

<p>The boys now took leave of the old woman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
and the rest of the day they spent visiting
various points of interest in the vicinity of the
plantation. They also fished and went in
swimming in a small stream which flowed near
by and emptied into the Chagres.</p>

<p>At nightfall, four tired but happy boys were
glad to get an early supper and seek the rest
which a day of unusual activity demanded.</p>

<p>The next day, according to his plan, Mr.
Andrews returned and remained overnight
with Vasco's hospitable uncle.</p>

<p>Early Saturday morning, amid profuse expressions
of regret at their departure and with
invitations to come again, the travellers took up
their journey homeward. This was made
without special incident and was completed in
safety.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />

<small>NEW AMBITION</small></h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Did</span> you have a good time on your trip
with Harlan and his father?" asked Lieutenant
Barretas of Vasco.</p>

<p>"To be sure I did," was the answer. "I
am not likely ever to forget the sights I have
seen in this journey through our country."</p>

<p>"I hope you thanked your American friends
for the pleasure you have enjoyed."</p>

<p>"I did, father."</p>

<p>"Our people are much indebted to the
Americans for the prosperity into which we
have come. I have some more good news to
tell you now."</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Vasco, his face aglow
with eager anticipation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>"To-morrow a public school is to be opened,
and I have decided that you shall attend."</p>

<p>This conversation occurred on Sunday, the
day after Vasco's arrival home. The lieutenant
was making his usual Sunday visit with his
family, though he had come a little late on
account of army affairs that had called him
to the Blue House&mdash;the President's mansion.
It was there that he had learned about the
school.</p>

<p>Vasco received the information with a doubtful
smile. A few weeks before he would have
been sad to hear such a suggestion. But his
acquaintance with Harlan, and especially the
close companionship of the past week, had
wrought certain changes in his spirit, and a
dawning ambition had begun to arise within
him.</p>

<p>He had come to see that there was a world
different from that in which he had lived,&mdash;that
his friend Harlan was of that world,&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
that the key to that world was knowledge.
And knowledge, he knew, could be obtained
only by hard labour. Was it worth the
effort?</p>

<p>That was the question Vasco asked himself
as he stood before his father.</p>

<p>To his credit be it said that his answer was
the right one.</p>

<p>"I am glad of the chance," at last he told
his father. "You may be sure that I shall try
to make the best of it."</p>

<p>Let it be said here that this opportunity to
go to school was a result of the formation of
the new republic of Panama. One of the
provisions of its constitution is: "Primary
instruction shall be compulsory, and, when
public, shall be free. There shall also be
schools of arts and trades."</p>

<p>Monday morning Vasco and his sister Inez
together started for school. To them, thus
far, the institution was but a name, vague<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
in its meaning, but full of great possibilities.</p>

<p>May we not well leave our little Panama
cousin right here, as he stands on the threshold
of a new life, under the folds of a new
flag, with a new ambition and an earnest purpose
spurring him on to attain to a higher and
better life than he has ever known?</p>
